# Set up your PagerDuty Account

You will need a PagerDuty account to receive alerts from Cloudwatch. If you would like to use a free account, you can sign up for a Developer Account from PagerDuty. It contains certain restrictions but is designed for those who want to work in a safe environment, but is not intended to be a production instance. More information on PagerDuty Developer accounts is found [here](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/app-integration-development/developer-account/).

### Sign up

Go to https://developer.pagerduty.com and fill out the form and create a Developer account and subdomain.

Once your account has been created, you will be logged in and directed to the Developer Mode dashboard. Click on the upper left hand PagerDuty logo to go to the Incident Dashboard.
