## Module Summary

In this section, we learned that AWS and PagerDuty work together so that when a problem is detected via a CloudWatch Alarm, it can send it to PagerDuty to mobilize the right team, give them relevant information on the problem and manage the incident to resolution. 

We also learned how to:

- Create a PagerDuty Service with a CloudWatch Integration 
- Create an SNS Topic
- Create a Notification on the SNS Topic that sends an event to PagerDuty
- Create a new CloudWatch Alarm
